Before starting programming you should know the basic syntax rules

## Comment
Comments start with `;` and comments are ignored by the [lexer](https://github.com/evvive/call-language/blob/6e89f9eebde6f751af85edb4d3f2686dcfff2cba/src/call/lexer/linelexer.py#L107)
```asm
; This is a comment
This is not a comment ; syntax error
```

## Instructions
The program flow and the I/O is controlled by the instructions, the
instructions are like this:
```asm
instr a ; instruction: instr
        ; parameter 1: a
        ; parameter 2: nothing
```

## Variables
The variables are boxes that can contain a value, each variable has a **type**
and a **value**:
```asm
instr @a ; instruction: instr
         ; parameter 1: "a" variable value
```

That's it...
